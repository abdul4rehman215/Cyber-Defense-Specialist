# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 02: SIEM Tool Configuration (Wazuh)

---

## Q1. What is the primary purpose of a SIEM solution like Wazuh?
**Answer:**  
A SIEM solution like Wazuh is used to centrally collect, correlate, analyze, and monitor security logs and events in order to detect threats, generate alerts, and support incident response.

---

## Q2. Which main components were installed to build the Wazuh SIEM setup?
**Answer:**  
The setup included Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Agent, Elasticsearch for log storage, Kibana for visualization, and the Wazuh Kibana plugin.

---

## Q3. What role does the Wazuh Manager perform?
**Answer:**  
The Wazuh Manager processes logs received from agents, applies detection rules, generates alerts, manages active responses, and coordinates overall SIEM operations.

---

## Q4. Why was the Wazuh Agent installed on the same system?
**Answer:**  
The agent was installed locally to collect system, authentication, and file integrity logs from the host and forward them to the Wazuh Manager for analysis.

---

## Q5. What is the function of Elasticsearch in this lab?
**Answer:**  
Elasticsearch stores and indexes security events, allowing fast searching, correlation, and retrieval of log data for analysis and visualization.

---

## Q6. Why is Kibana required in a Wazuh SIEM deployment?
**Answer:**  
Kibana provides dashboards, visualizations, and search capabilities that allow analysts to monitor alerts, analyze security events, and investigate incidents.

---

## Q7. Which logs were monitored for security detection?
**Answer:**  
Authentication logs, system logs, Apache access and error logs, and file integrity monitoring events were collected and analyzed.

---

## Q8. What is File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and why is it important?
**Answer:**  
FIM detects unauthorized file creation or modification in critical directories such as `/etc`. It is important for identifying configuration tampering and potential persistence techniques.

---

## Q9. Why were custom Wazuh rules created in this lab?
**Answer:**  
Custom rules were created to improve detection of specific threats, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same source and unauthorized file changes in sensitive directories.

---

## Q10. What is Active Response in Wazuh?
**Answer:**  
Active Response is an automated security action triggered by alerts, such as blocking an IP address after repeated failed login attempts.

---

## Q11. How were test security events generated during the lab?
**Answer:**  
Events were generated by simulating failed authentication attempts, modifying protected system files, and creating network activity using tools like `ping` and `curl`.

---

## Q12. How was agent connectivity verified?
**Answer:**  
Agent connectivity was verified using the `agent_control -l` command and by confirming that logs and alerts appeared in the Wazuh dashboard.

---

## Q13. What type of alerts were observed in the Wazuh dashboard?
**Answer:**  
Alerts included authentication failures, file integrity changes, network-related activity, and active response executions.

---

## Q14. How does Wazuh support SOC operations?
**Answer:**  
Wazuh provides centralized log analysis, threat detection, alerting, and automated response, enabling SOC teams to detect and respond to incidents efficiently.

---

## Q15. How does this lab prepare you for real-world SOC roles?
**Answer:**  
The lab provides hands-on experience with SIEM deployment, log correlation, alert analysis, and incident response workflows that closely mirror real SOC analyst responsibilities.
