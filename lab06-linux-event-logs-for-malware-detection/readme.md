# 🧪 Lab 6: Linux Event Logs for Malware Detection

## 🎯 Overview

This lab focuses on detecting malware indicators using native Linux logging mechanisms.  
System logs were analyzed, filtered, and automated detection logic was implemented using both Bash and Python.

The lab simulates suspicious authentication events and demonstrates how to extract, parse, and monitor logs for security intelligence.

## 🖥️ Lab Environment

- **OS:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS  
- **User:** toor  
- **Python:** 3.x  
- **Log Sources:** syslog, auth.log, journald  

---

## 🧩 Tasks Performed

### 🔎 Log Exploration
- Navigated `/var/log`
- Reviewed `syslog`, `auth.log`, and `journalctl`
- Generated test security events

### 📂 Log Extraction & Filtering
- Extracted date-based logs
- Filtered authentication failures
- Filtered warnings and error events
- Built automated Bash-based extraction workflow

### 🐍 Python Log Parser
- Created structured syslog parser
- Implemented malware-relevant pattern detection
- Generated process frequency baseline
- Identified suspicious authentication & crash indicators

### ⚠️ Anomaly Detection
- Built anomaly detection engine
- Implemented risk scoring (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- Generated structured JSON report

### 🔴 Real-Time Monitoring
- Implemented live log monitoring using tail -f
- Triggered alerts on suspicious patterns
- Simulated failed login events to validate detection

## 🔐 Security Relevance

Linux logs are a primary forensic and detection data source.  
This lab demonstrates how malware and post-exploitation behavior can be detected through:

- Authentication anomalies  
- Privilege misuse  
- System crash indicators  
- Network activity traces  
- Behavioral deviations

## 🧾 Conclusion

In this lab, Linux logs were transformed into actionable security intelligence using structured parsing, anomaly detection, and real-time monitoring.

This workflow mirrors foundational SOC log analysis and malware detection operations.
