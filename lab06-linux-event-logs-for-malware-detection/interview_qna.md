# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 6: Linux Event Logs for Malware Detection

<br>

### Q1. Why are Linux system logs important for malware detection?

**Answer:**
Linux system logs record authentication attempts, system service activity, kernel events, and network behavior. Malware often leaves traces in these logs such as failed logins, privilege escalation attempts, abnormal process crashes, or suspicious network activity. Analyzing logs helps detect early compromise indicators.

### Q2. Which key log files were analyzed in this lab?

**Answer:**
The primary log sources analyzed were:

* `/var/log/syslog` – General system activity
* `/var/log/auth.log` – Authentication and privilege events
* `journalctl` (systemd journal) – Structured system logs
* `/var/log/kern.log` – Kernel-level events

These logs provide visibility into user actions, system processes, and security-relevant events.

---

### Q3. What types of suspicious events were simulated during the lab?

**Answer:**
The lab simulated:

* Failed authentication attempts
* Invalid user login attempts
* Custom security log entries using `logger`
* ICMP network activity
* Privilege escalation activity (sudo/su usage)

These activities mimic common malware and attacker behaviors.

---

### Q4. How were security-related log entries filtered from large log files?

**Answer:**
Security-relevant entries were filtered using `grep` with case-insensitive search patterns such as:

* `failed`
* `authentication failure`
* `invalid user`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `denied`

This allowed targeted extraction of suspicious events from large log files.

---

### Q5. What was the purpose of the Bash log analysis script (analyze_logs.sh)?

**Answer:**
The Bash script automated:

* Extraction of suspicious network activity
* Collection of failed authentication attempts
* Identification of unusual process events
* Generation of summary statistics

It streamlined manual log investigation and provided structured output for further analysis.

---

### Q6. Why was a Python log parser developed instead of only using Bash?

**Answer:**
Python provides:

* Structured parsing using regular expressions
* Pattern-based anomaly detection
* Statistical analysis (process frequency counting)
* Better scalability for large log files
* More advanced detection logic compared to simple text filtering

Python enables more intelligent and extensible malware detection workflows.

---

### Q7. Which malware-related indicators were detected by the Python parser?

**Answer:**
The parser detected:

* Failed password attempts
* Authentication failures
* Invalid users
* Permission denied events
* Segmentation faults

These indicators are commonly associated with brute-force attacks, privilege escalation, or unstable malicious processes.

---

### Q8. What does anomaly detection mean in the context of this lab?

**Answer:**
Anomaly detection refers to identifying unusual or abnormal log patterns that deviate from expected baseline behavior. For example:

* Excessive failed login attempts
* Unexpected root-level actions
* Repeated authentication failures

Such anomalies may indicate malware activity or unauthorized access attempts.

---

### Q9. How was risk level calculated in the anomaly detection script?

**Answer:**
Risk level was determined based on the number of detected anomalies:

* **LOW** → Fewer than 5 anomalies
* **MEDIUM** → 5–9 anomalies
* **HIGH** → 10 or more anomalies

This provided a simple but effective threat severity classification model.

---

### Q10. Why is real-time log monitoring critical for security operations?

**Answer:**
Real-time monitoring enables:

* Immediate detection of active threats
* Rapid response to brute-force attacks
* Faster containment of compromised accounts
* Reduced attacker dwell time

In a SOC environment, delayed detection can lead to significant damage. Real-time alerting ensures faster incident response.

---

### Q11. What is the advantage of generating a JSON report in malware detection?

**Answer:**
JSON reports allow:

* Easy integration with SIEM systems
* Machine-readable structured output
* API-based alerting
* Automated reporting pipelines

This supports scalable and enterprise-ready security monitoring.

---

### Q12. How can this lab be extended in real-world environments?

**Answer:**
This lab can be extended by:

* Forwarding logs to a SIEM (ELK, Wazuh, Splunk)
* Adding machine learning-based anomaly detection
* Integrating email/SMS alerts
* Correlating logs across multiple hosts
* Monitoring additional log sources like Apache, Nginx, or Docker
