# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 5: Detecting Post-Exploitation Traffic

<br>
### Q1. What is post-exploitation traffic in a cybersecurity context?

**Answer:**
Post-exploitation traffic refers to attacker activity that occurs after the initial system compromise. This includes lateral movement within the network, privilege escalation attempts, and communication with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.

---

### Q2. Why was the loopback interface (lo) used in this lab?

**Answer:**
The loopback interface was used to safely simulate malicious traffic locally on the same system without impacting external networks. It allows controlled attack traffic generation for analysis purposes.

---

### Q3. Which ports were monitored to detect lateral movement activity?

**Answer:**
Port 445 (SMB) and port 3389 (RDP) were monitored, as they are commonly used for file sharing and remote desktop access during lateral movement.

---

### Q4. What type of traffic pattern indicates lateral movement?

**Answer:**
Repeated internal connection attempts to administrative ports (SMB/RDP), port scanning behavior, and multiple SYN packets without completed sessions are strong indicators of lateral movement.

---

### Q5. What is C2 beaconing and how was it identified?

**Answer:**
C2 beaconing is periodic communication from an infected host to an attacker-controlled server. It was identified through repeated HTTP GET requests at regular intervals to the same destination.

---
### Q6. Why is Base64-encoded data suspicious in network traffic?

**Answer:**
Base64 encoding is commonly used by attackers to obfuscate commands or exfiltrated data in C2 communications, making it harder to detect through simple inspection.

---

### Q7. What made traffic on port 4444 suspicious in this lab?

**Answer:**
Port 4444 is a non-standard service port often used by malware for encrypted C2 communication. Encrypted-looking payloads over this port increased the risk classification.

---

### Q8. How did Wireshark help in identifying C2 behavior?

**Answer:**
Wireshark helped by allowing protocol filtering, timing analysis, inspection of payload content, detection of SYN-only patterns, and analysis of unusual ports and encoded traffic.

---

### Q9. What was the purpose of the automated C2 detection script?

**Answer:**
The script analyzed PCAP files for beaconing behavior, unusual ports, and Base64-encoded payloads, then calculated a risk score to classify traffic as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH risk.

---

### Q10. Why is detecting post-exploitation activity critical for SOC teams?

**Answer:**
Because attackers already have access during post-exploitation, early detection allows SOC teams to contain the breach, disrupt command channels, prevent data exfiltration, and stop full domain compromise.
